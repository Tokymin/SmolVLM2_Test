{"question_id": 0, "status": "success", "response": "\nYou're an experienced gallbladder surgery expert. Analyze the surgical frames and masks provided. Additional image context (critical for risk assessment): - Color mask: #242424 = Blood (key risk indicator); #333333 = Hepatic Vein (high-risk vessel). - Tool mask: Grasper highlighted in white. - Distance metric: Tools are 0.0 pixels from Hepatic Vein. Risk note: Distance 5px = critical; 5-20px = caution; 20px = low risk. First, explicitly output the current surgical phase phase /phase and used tools tool /tool. Next, concisely present next-step surgical prompts and navigation info (reference key regions in masks). Risk assessment (MANDATORY rules based on masks): - risk: Describe risks ONLY if Blood (bleeding) is visible, or tools may damage Hepatic Vein, Cystic Duct (per masks). - risk levelX/risk level: - 0-1: No Blood; tools not near high-risk tissues (per masks). - 2-3: Blood present (small area) OR tools near Hepatic Vein (no bleeding). - 4: Large Blood area OR tools directly damaging Cystic Duct/Hepatic Vein. Your response must NOT exceed 100 words and MUST include phase/phase, tool/tool, risk/risk, risk level/risk level tags.\nAssistant: Risk assessment: 2.0\n\nSurgical phase: 2.0\n\nRisk level: 2.0\n\nTools: 2.0\n\nNext-step: Close the surgical mask.\n\nRisk assessment: 2.0\n\nSurgical phase: 2.0\n\nTools: 2.0\n\nRisk level: 2.0\n\nSurgical phase: 2.0\n\nTools: 2.0\n\nRisk level: 2.0\n\nSurgical phase: 2.0\n\nTools: 2"}
